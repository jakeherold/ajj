  * **Step 1**: enter your vehicle year, make, model, and engine type.

  * **Step 2**: enter your start and endpoint locations, and as many midpoints as you would like, click *submit*.

* **Then you get**: overview of your trip on google-maps with a breakdown of your **trip stats**, **gas cost**, and **mpg data** for *your* specific vehicle.
